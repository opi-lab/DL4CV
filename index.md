# Deep Learning for Computer Vision

### Second semester 2022

Andrés Marrugo, PhD       
*Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar*

##  Aims and Scope

This semester course will provide a practical introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Covered topics covered will include: linear classifiers; multilayer neural networks; stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation; convolutional neural networks and their applications to computer vision tasks such as object detection and dense image labeling. Course work will consist of programming tasks in Python.

At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Gain experience in computer vision research.
- Get exposure to a variety of topics and become familiar with modern machine learning and deep learning techniques.
- Learn to write and present works of a technical-academic nature.
- Gain hands-on experience developing machine learning systems.

<!-- Prior knowledge of this course includes probability, linear algebra, and calculus. Programming experience in MATLAB is desirable, but not required. -->


<!-- This semester course is an introduction to computer vision. It is aimed at graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. We will focus on the practical and theoretical aspects of techniques in computer vision. -->

<!-- At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Have clear idea of challenges in computer vision due to increasing use in mobile applications.
- Understand many different computer vision algorithms and approaches.
- Implement computer vision algorithms for mid-level vision tasks. -->


## Useful Resources
 
We will be using Jupyter Python notebooks as a numerical computing and graphical platform for solving many problems in the course. To avoid installing Jupyter Python locally, I encourage you to use Google Colab.
